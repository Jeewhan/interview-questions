Target Number
=============

Problem: Given a list of sorted integers in ascending order and a target number
`k` which is an integer, determine whether it is possible to pick two integers
from the list that add up to the target number.

For example,

    list = [-5, 0, 2, 3, 7, 8], k = 9

then `2 + 7 = 9`, hence the answer is `true`. If `k = 1` the answer is `false`
as no two numbers from the list add up to `1`.

Time complexity: Should be faster than *O(n<sup>2</sup>)*.

Time limit: 15 min
