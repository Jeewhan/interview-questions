Merge Sort
==========

Problem 1: Given two lists of sorted integers (in ascending order), merge
them into a single list.

Problem 2: Discuss an algorithm to merge `k` lists. Analyze time complexity of
the algorithm. Can you make it faster? (Hint: *O(nk log k)* is possible)

Problem 3: Implement merge sort algorithm using the function above.

Time limit: 45 min
