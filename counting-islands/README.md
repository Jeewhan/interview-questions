Counting Islands
================

Problem: A world is described as an `n`-by-`m` 2D array of `0`s and `1`s. `0`
and `1` represent water and land respectively. An islands is defined as a chunk
of land surrounded by water.

Either horizontally or vertically consecutive series of `1`s is considered as a
distinct island. Diagonally adjacent `1`s are not considered as a single
island.

For example, the following world contains five islands.

```
1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0
0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1
0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1
1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0
```

You may assume that no island contains a lake (water surrounded by land).
