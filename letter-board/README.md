Letter Board
============

NOTE: This was for an online coding test, rather than for an on-site interview.
I was provided with a basic editor, [CoderPad](https://coderpad.io), with no
typical IDE-like features whatsoever. The only thing comes in handy was
auto-indentation.

Problem: Given an `N` by `N` board with letters and a word, determine whether
the word appears on the board.

- You may traverse in any (up, down, right, left, all diagonal) direction
- You may change the direction at each step
- You may *not* re-use a letter at the same location

For example, a board may look like this:

```
T Z J Q
A R E E
P B A S
C F X H
```

Then you will find words like `TREE`, `TAR`, `BEE`, `SEA`, and so on.
