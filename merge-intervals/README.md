Merge Intervals
===============

Problem 1: Merge two intervals, where an interval is defined as a tuple of
`[min, max]`. If those two intervals have no *overlapping*, return the original
input as-is. The output is a list of intervals.

Suppose two intervals are given as `[1, 3]`, `[2, 5]` then the merged interval
is `[[1, 5]]`. When `[1, 2]`, `[5, 7]` are given, then the output shall be
`[[1, 2], [5, 7]]`.

Problem 2: Merge `k` intervals.
