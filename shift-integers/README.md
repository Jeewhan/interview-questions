Shift Integers
==============

Problem: Given a list of integers, shift non-zeros to the left (or shift zeros
to the right). The order of elements must be preserved. For example, suppose we
are given a list of integers like:

    [1, 3, -4, 0, 9, 2, 0, 5]

Then the outcome is expected to be:

    [1, 3, -4, 9, 2, 5, 0, 0]

Expected time complexity: O(n)  
Expected space complexity: O(1)

Time limit: 15 min
