# Interview Questions

Job interviews sometimes can be a daunting task. Especially when you're confronted with those good old algorithm and data structure problems. If it has been a while since you're out of school, you might not have much of opportunities to juggle with basic computer science stuff (e.g., implementing a sorting algorithm, traversing a graph, etc.) on your regular daily job. On the top of that, you are generally expected to write complete, working code on a whiteboard or a basic text editor without syntax highlighting.

I recently had a number of job interviews with different companies. Some interviews went well, others were a bit challenging. I've created this repository in an attempt to *learn from mistakes*.

Focus on two things:
* Getting a complete, working solution (avoid brute-force solutions though)
* Writing code on a white board, or on a basic text editor without syntax highlighting

(TODO: Keep writing stuff down)
