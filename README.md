# Interview Questions

Job interviews sometimes can be a daunting task. Especially when you're confronted with those good old algorithm and data structure problems. If it has been a while since you're out of school, you won't have much of opportunities to juggle with basic computer science stuff on a regular daily job.

I recently had a number of job interview with different companies. There were some interviews that went well, but I struggled with some of them. I've created this repository in an attempt to *learn from mistakes*.

Focus on two things:
* Getting a complete, working solution (avoid brute-force solutions though)
* Writing code on a white board, or on a basic text editor without syntax highlighting
